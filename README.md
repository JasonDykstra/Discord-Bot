# Discord-Bot
A Discord bot I made for my friends and myself

This Discord bot was made using the JDABot library. I made this in freshman year (2015-16) for my friends to use as a music bot since the ones we used sometimes went offline or lagged. I ended up making many more features available than just music.

The bot used to run remotely on my raspberry pi. When I wanted to update the bot, I would ssh into the pi and copy my files over.

Currently, the bot is inactive due to audio API updates that I could not figure out how to install.
